        <li><h2>For the cake</h2></li>
            <ol><h3>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted (because even Mickey wouldn't tolerate lumpy flour)</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, for sweetness that'll make you shout "Oh, boy!"</li>
                <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, for a rich, dark chocolate flavor as deep as Mickey's voice</li>
                <li> teaspoon baking soda, to give the cake a lift, just like Mickey's positive attitude</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, a pinch of magic to balance the sweetness</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk, for a moist and tender crumb like Mickey's big, soft ears</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, to keep things smooth like Mickey's dance moves</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, for binding and richness, because Mickey's cake deserves the best</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract, a touch of magic to make the cake sing like a chorus of Mickeys</li>  
            </ol></h3>
        <li><h2>For the frosting</h2></li>
            <ol><h3>
                <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened to the texture of Mickey's warm smile</li> 
                <li> 3 cups powdered sugar, for sweetness that'll have you whistling "Heigh-Ho" </li>
                <li> 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, for a chocolatey depth that rivals Mickey's mysterious past</li>
                <li>1/4 cup milk, for a smooth and creamy consistency like Mickey's velvety gloves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract, a sprinkle of pixie dust to make the frosting taste like a trip to Disneyland</li>
            </ol></h3>
        <li><h2>For the decoration
        </h2></li>
            <ol><h3>
                <li>Black and white candy melts, for crafting Mickey's iconic features like a skilled Imagineer</li>
                <li>Red candy melts, for a splash of color that'll make your cake as cheerful as Mickey's laugh</li>
                <li>Round chocolate wafers, for Mickey's iconic ears, because who wants a Mickey Mouse cake without the ears?</li>
                <li>Sprinkles, because every Mickey Mouse cake deserves a sprinkle of magic (and because sprinkles are just plain fun)</li>
            </ol></h3>
    </ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol><h3>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Remember, a well-greased pan is a happy pan, and a happy pan makes a happy cake, just like a happy Mickey makes a happy world.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Imagine you're conducting an orchestra of dry ingredients, each playing its part in the symphony of deliciousness.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract. This is the wet ingredient band, and they're ready to join the dry ingredient orchestra for a grand finale.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Don't overmix! You want a smooth and even batter, not a tough and overworked one. Remember, even Mickey takes breaks.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. While the cakes bake, imagine them transforming into Mickey</li>
